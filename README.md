# Overview

As a software developer aiming to expand my skills in Kotlin, this basic calculator project serves as a practical demonstration of the language. 
The software is a simple calculator application implemented in Kotlin, it's functionalities are centered on performing fundamental arithmetic operations and trigonometric functions.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to deepen my understanding of Kotlin's basic syntax, OOP concepts, and standard library functions. 
Working on this basic calculator has helped solidified my knowledge on how to set up a Kotlin development environment and deepened
my knowledge of Kotlin's capabilities in handling mathematical computations efficiently.

## JDK (Java Development Kit)

This project requires the Java Development Kit (JDK). Make sure you have JDK 8 or later installed on your system. And don't forget to download IntelliJ IDEA

### Installing JDK

- You can download JDK from [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK distributions.
